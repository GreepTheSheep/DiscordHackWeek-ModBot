Hi, I'm Greep and this is a bot you can host in your machine.
This is a moderation bot, you can have basics moderation commands such kick, ban, unban and infos commands.
You can have also a logging channel, more powerful for the mods and admins.

## Installation:
Before we starting, you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), I advise you pick the version [8.16.0](https://nodejs.org/dist/v8.16.0/)

### Simple installation: (for Windows users):
Clone the repo, execute the `start.bat` and follow the instructions.

### Advanced installation: (for Linux/Mac/Unix users):
Clone the repo, create a file called token.json and type the following:
```json
{"token": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"}
```
PS: The bot token can be accessible at https://discordapp.com/developpers

Once you created the file, open a command line (Terminal) and type: 
```
npm install
```

Once it's done, type:
```
npm start!
```

Enjoy !
